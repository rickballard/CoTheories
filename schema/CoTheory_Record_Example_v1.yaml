summary_coSpeak: >
  The Standard Model is a quantum field theory that describes three of the four
  known fundamental forces; electromagnetic; weak; and strong; and classifies
  all known elementary particles except gravity. It is highly predictive and
  experimentally confirmed; yet known to be incomplete.

notes_coMeta: >
  In CoMeta; the Standard Model stands as an example of a powerful yet incomplete
  human theory; a reminder that even highly successful models may miss key parts
  of reality; such as gravity or dark sectors.
